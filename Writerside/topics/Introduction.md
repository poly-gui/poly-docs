# What is NanoPack?

NanoPack is a binary serialization format created for Poly.
Messages sent between the application-side and the native-side are serialized with NanoPack.
Because of the large amount of messages exchanged between the two sides, NanoPack is designed to be easy to pack and parse.

NanoPack is currently being implemented in C++, TypeScript, and Swift.
